Started Ray on this node. You can add additional nodes to the cluster by calling

    ray start --redis-address 10.5.9.30:6380

from the node you wish to add. You can connect a driver to the cluster from Python by running

    import ray
    ray.init(redis_address="10.5.9.30:6380")

If you have trouble connecting from a different machine, check that your firewall is configured properly. If you wish to terminate the processes that have been started, run

    ray stop
